# Welcome to Z3-BatchSolver!

**Z3-BatchSolver** is a Python CLI tool for batch-processing `.smt2` files using the Z3 solver and exporting detailed results to a single `.csv` file.

---

**### üß∞ Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maheenmatin/Z3-BatchSolver
   cd Z3-BatchSolver
   ```

2. **Optional: Install Poetry** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pipx install poetry
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   poetry env activate
   ```

5. **Run solver:**
   - Specify the time limit (in milliseconds) for each check-sat and the path to the directory containing the SMT2 files.
   - Example values:
      - Timeout: **30s**
      - File structure: **root -> tests**
   ```bash
   poetry run run-Z3 --time_limit 30000 --tests_dir ./tests
   ```

6. **See results:**
   - A `results/` directory is created as a sibling to the directory containing SMT2 files
   - The output CSV is saved to the `results/` directory

### üöÄ Why This Project?

While building [CRTSolver](https://github.com/maheenmatin/CRTSolver), a program that leverages the Chinese Remainder Theorem for increased performance in solving non-linear integer equations, I realized there was no easy way to batch-process a folder of SMT-LIB problems using Z3 while retrieving:

- Satisfiability results
- Variable assignments (models) for satisfiable problems
- Solver runtime
- Problem metadata (e.g. max polynomial degree, number of variables, number of assertions, etc)

To evaluate CRTSolver against native cvc5 and Z3 performance, I built custom batch runners ‚Äî this tool is the result of generalizing and polishing that effort.

---

### üîç What It Does

- Recursively processes all `.smt2` files in a given folder
- Uses Z3's **Python API**
- For each file, extracts:
  - Solver status (`sat`, `unsat`, or `unknown`)
  - Model values (for satisfiable problems)
  - Solver runtime
  - Problem metadata
- Aggregates results into a clean, analyzable `.csv` file

### üß† Why It‚Äôs Different

Most SMT tools are solver-agnostic, and geared toward large-scale experiments with comparisons across different solvers and solver configurations. This project is:
- **Lightweight** and specifically **Z3-focused**
- Optimized for **CSV output** and **donwstream analysis**
- Intended for **general use cases** where solving a batch of problems takes precedence over benchmarking
- **Easy to integrate** into solver pipelines or research workflows

### üì¶ Coming Soon
- Revised test setup - no need to organise by number of variables and maximum degree!
